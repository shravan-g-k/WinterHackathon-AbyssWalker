      notes: [
        "Explanation: A crime is a public wrong. It is an act or omission that is prohibited and punishable by law because it harms not just an individual, but society as a whole.",
        "Offence against the State: Because crimes disturb public peace, the Government (the State) takes action against the criminal, rather than the victim fighting the case alone.",
        "Legality: An act is only a crime if a specific law declares it illegal. You cannot be punished for something that isn't written in the law books.",
        "Social Impact: Criminal law serves as a deterrent, meaning it uses the fear of punishment to prevent people from breaking the law.",
        "Example: If someone commits theft, it is seen as a threat to everyone's right to own property, which is why the police intervene on behalf of the public."

      title: "2. Types of Crimes (Cognizable vs. Non-Cognizable)",
      notes: [
        "Classification: Crimes are divided by their level of seriousness to determine how much power the police have in the situation.",
        "Cognizable Crimes: These are serious offences (e.g., Murder, Rape, Dowry Death). In these cases, the police can arrest the suspect without a warrant and start an investigation without a magistrate's order.",
        "Non-Cognizable Crimes: These are less serious (e.g., Defamation, simple hurt). The police cannot arrest without a warrant and must wait for court permission to investigate.",
        "Public Safety: Cognizable classification allows police to act immediately in dangerous situations to prevent further harm.",
        "Example: If a robbery is in progress (Cognizable), the police can catch the thief immediately. If someone insults another person (Non-cognizable), the police must wait for a court order."

      notes: [
        "Penalty: Punishment is the legal consequence for an offence, decided exclusively by the Judiciary, not the Police.",
        "Deterrence: The aim is to create fear in potential offenders to stop them from committing crimes.",
        "Reformation: Modern law also focuses on 'Reformative Justice'—helping the criminal change their behavior so they can rejoin society.",
        "Protection: By imprisoning dangerous individuals, the law protects the innocent members of the community.",

        "FIR (First Information Report): For cognizable crimes, the police are legally bound to register an FIR, which is the starting point of the criminal justice process.",
        "Investigation: This involves visiting the crime scene, questioning witnesses, and collecting physical evidence like fingerprints or weapons.",
        "Charge Sheet: Once the investigation is complete, the police file a 'Charge Sheet' in court, detailing the evidence against the accused.",
